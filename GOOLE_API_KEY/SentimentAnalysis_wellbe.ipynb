question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and scientists for millennia. There is no one definitive answer, and the meaning of life may be different for different people. Some common answers to the question include:\n> \n> * **To find happiness and fulfillment**\n> * **To make a difference in the world**\n> * **To connect with others**\n> * **To learn and grow**\n> * **To serve a higher purpose**\n> \n> Ultimately, the meaning of life is something that each individual must determine for themselves. There is no right or wrong answer, and the search for meaning can be a lifelong journey.\n> \n> Here are some additional thoughts on the meaning of life:\n> \n> * **The meaning of life is not static**. It can change as we grow and change throughout our lives.\n> * **The meaning of life is not something that is found**. It is something that is created.\n> * **The meaning of life is not something that is given to us**. It is something that we must find for ourselves.\n> \n> The search for meaning can be a difficult and challenging one. However, it is a worthwhile one.

The molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, particularly nitrogen and oxygen, scatter shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) more effectively than longer wavelengths (red and yellow). This scattering causes the blue light to be more visible and gives the sky its blue color. This effect is known as Rayleigh scattering.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":28}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Batching API Calls (Single Shot)"],"metadata":{"id":"lvmCHV2_oRIg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_set.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rxnE1MTwKWuV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706856783384,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Gopal Sharma","userId":"12839894256006393174"}},"outputId":"f7174b8b-c486-4723-e891-fb55fd56b9f6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(488, 3)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":29}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_set_total = test_set.sample(100)\n","\n","test_set_total['pred_label'] = ''\n","\n","test_set_total"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"828-QqWmoWSJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706856793326,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":849,"user":{"displayName":"Gopal Sharma","userId":"12839894256006393174"}},"outputId":"3abd91d4-d78b-4da5-858a-98838db33463"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                 review  label  \\\n","2786                                    Very convenient      1   \n","1913  Excellent why didn’t I think it is in the begi...      1   \n","2621                                            Love it      1   \n","672   Bought this to go in my niece's room.

times it seems very intuitive but at other times ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result installation was fairly straightforward but messed up several times simply because thought step was complete when it wasn this actually made me lose ground until figured that out my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step my biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and would like to use them as intercoms which am told can be done however can make any of the echos aware of the others existence when ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name know this is likely my fault but would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the

screen you can turn off the screen scroll but that defeats the purpose of having the screen don need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things can do with alexa don need the advertising especially at

you pretty much have to talk which is not thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like yes you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss then you completely delete your recurring alarm this is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it setting to decide whether touching the screen for recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off but as the clock has been out for year now and they still haven adding this
